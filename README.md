## Processor

## What is a ISA (short)
_processor must execute a sequence of instructions, where each instruction performs some primitive operation, such as adding two numbers. An instruction is encoded in binary form as a sequence of 1 or more bytes. The instructions supported by a particular processor and their byte-level encodings are known as its instruction set architecture (ISA). Different “families” of processors, such as Intel IA32 and x86-64, IBM/Freescale Power, and the ARM processor family, have different ISAs. A program compiled for one type of machine will not run on another. On the other hand, there are many dif- ferent models of processors within a single family. Each manufacturer produces processors of ever-growing performance and complexity, but the different models remain compatible at the ISA level. Popular families, such as x86-64, have pro- cessors supplied by multiple manufacturers. Thus, the **ISA provides a conceptual/functional layer of abstraction between compiler writers, who need only know what instructions are permitted and how they are encoded, and processor designers, who must build machines that execute those instructions.**_
